/*
 * In the above example, ‘student1‘ is an object of ‘Student‘ class which has
 * three fields – id, name and course. ‘course‘ is a reference variable pointing
 * to a ‘Course‘ type object. Clone of ‘student1‘ is created by calling clone
 * method on it and assigned it to ‘student2‘. As default version of clone
 * method creates the shallow copy, the ‘course‘ field of both ‘student1‘ and
 * ‘student2‘ will be pointing to same ‘Course‘ object. So, any changes made to
 * this object through ‘student2‘ will be reflected in ‘student1‘ or vice-versa.
